# hcfa-synth

Synthetic CMS-1500 (HCFA) claim form generator. Produces paired `(image, ground_truth.json)` samples across a difficulty spectrum — pristine digital through worst-case scanned/photographed — for benchmarking medical-claim extraction pipelines.

## Why

Real CMS-1500 forms contain PHI; you can't ship them. This generator emits unlimited PHI-free synthetic forms with matching ground truth, so extraction models can be trained and benchmarked in the open.

## Quickstart

```bash
pip install -e .
python -m hcfa_synth generate --count 20 --tiers all --seed 42 --out ./data/sanity
```

Output layout:

```
data/sanity/
├── pristine/    00000.png  00000.json  00000.pdf  ...
├── clean_scan/  ...
├── worn_scan/   ...
├── fax/         ...
├── phone_photo/ ...
├── worst/       ...
└── manifest.jsonl     # one line per sample with metadata
```

## Difficulty tiers

| Tier | Resembles | Key transforms |
|---|---|---|
| `pristine` | Native digital submission | None — direct render |
| `clean_scan` | Modern office scanner | ±1° skew, mild noise, slight fade |
| `worn_scan` | Old MFP / photocopy | ±3° skew, JPEG 60, fade, speckles |
| `fax` | Faxed claim form | Binary B&W, vertical streaks, downsample |
| `phone_photo` | Phone-snapped printout | Perspective warp, lighting gradient, shadow, blur |
| `worst` | Stress test | Crinkles, staple holes, coffee stain, redaction bars |

All tiers are deterministic given a seed.

## Ground-truth schema

Each `.json` has two layers:

- **`fields`** — flat dict keyed by the official PDF field name (e.g. `pt_name`, `cpt1`). Matches what an extractor reading the raw AcroForm sees.
- **`logical`** — nested by the 33 CMS-1500 boxes with normalized values (e.g. `box_2_patient_name.first`, `box_24_service_lines[]`). Matches what an extractor reading the rendered image would naturally produce.

Eval harnesses can score against either layer.

## Realism guarantees

- NPIs are **Luhn-valid** with the `80840` prefix (per CMS spec)
- ICD-10 codes drawn from the bundled CMS sample (`hcfa_synth/codes/icd10_sample.csv`, 247 codes)
- Procedure codes from HCPCS Level II (`hcpcs_sample.csv`, 132 codes — avoids CPT licensing)
- POS codes from the full place-of-service codeset (`pos_codes.csv`, 51 codes)
- Service dates ≤ today; DOB earlier than service date
- Box 28 total = sum of line charges
- Diagnosis pointers (A–L) only reference populated diagnoses
- Tax ID format matches type (SSN `xxx-xx-xxxx`, EIN `xx-xxxxxxx`)
- "Self" relationship mirrors patient demographics into insured fields

## Examples

12 ready-to-browse samples (2 per tier, 200 DPI) live in [`examples/`](./examples). Open any `.png` next to its `.json` to see the form and the ground truth side-by-side.

## Full benchmark dataset

The 500-sample benchmark dataset is published on HuggingFace Datasets — see [TODO: HuggingFace link, published in Week 4].

To regenerate the full dataset locally:

```bash
python -m hcfa_synth generate --count 500 --tiers all --seed 0 --out ./data/full --no-pdf
```

This takes ~5 minutes at 300 DPI and produces ~2.5 GB.

## Known limitations (v0)

- Checkbox/radio appearance marks (sex M/F, insurance type, yes/no boxes) may not render visually in the PNG — the `/V` values are set in the PDF correctly, so semantic extractors are unaffected. Fix planned: write `/AP` appearance streams for buttons.
- Box 32 facility NPI is unmapped (one of the numeric-named PDF fields).
- Handwriting tier deferred to v0.2.
